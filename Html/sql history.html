        <h3>SQL_history:-</h3>
        <pre>
            Introduced in the 1970s and developed by IBM 
            scientists Donald Chamberlin and Raymond Boyce, 
            SQL originated from the concept of relational models 
            and was initially called structured English query 
            language (SEQUEL) before being shortened to SQL. 
            It became commercially available in 1979 and 
            has since become the global standard for relational database 
            management systems (RDBMS).
